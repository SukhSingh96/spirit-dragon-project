# Heroes and Villains Project
The purpose of this project is to display a wide range of information for any superhero or villain that is selected via the search bar. 
The home page will display 4 different tabs on information related to the selected character. 
These tabs are Biography, Appearance, Relationships, and Worklife. 
These tabs deliver a plethora of information that provides the basic characteristics of the selected character.

There is also a compare page that allows the user to pin a character against another to see which statistics of one character outweigh the other. 
This feature allows the user to determine which hero or villain could potentially win in a battle against the other.
